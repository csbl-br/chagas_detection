# Introduction

Chagas detection is a tool for the detection of _T. cruzi_ trypomastigote forms in blood smear images. In particular, it provides a machine learning based method for the detection of parasites in images acquired using a mobile phone camera. This repository contains the codes for _T. cruzi_ detection. The images for training and testing the model are available at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5123062).
